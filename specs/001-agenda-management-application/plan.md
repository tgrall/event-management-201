# Implementation Plan: Agenda Management Application

**Branch**: `001-agenda-management-application` | **Date**: 2025-10-02 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-agenda-management-application/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
A comprehensive event and session management web application for organizing multi-day conferences. The system automatically generates hourly time slots (8am-6pm) for each event day, allows organizers to create sessions with speakers and tracks, and provides attendees with filtering and viewing capabilities. Key features include event management, session scheduling, speaker profiles with social links, track categorization, and tag-based filtering. Target: small-scale system supporting <100 concurrent users and <50 events with fast performance (<2s page load, <500ms interactions) and responsive design across mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript with Node.js 18+ (modern web standards)  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18+, Express.js, modern CSS framework (Tailwind CSS or equivalent)  
**Storage**: SQLite for development/demo (no backup required), JSON for simple data persistence  
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E, Lighthouse CI for performance  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions)
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend) - determines source structure  
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load, <500ms interactions, Lighthouse 90+ scores  
**Constraints**: Mobile-first responsive (320px, 768px, 1024px), WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, PWA features  
**Scale/Scope**: <100 concurrent users, <50 events, demo/development system

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected based on frontend + backend requirements. The backend provides REST API services with SQLite storage, while the frontend delivers a responsive React application with PWA capabilities. This separation enables independent development and deployment while maintaining clean architectural boundaries.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations identified. All requirements align with constitutional principles:
- Mobile-first responsive design implemented
- Performance targets defined and achievable
- Accessibility standards incorporated
- Component-driven architecture planned
- PWA features included
- Security approach appropriate for demo system
- TDD methodology confirmed

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - research.md created
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md created
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS - All requirements align with constitutional principles
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS - Design maintains constitutional compliance
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved - Clarifications completed in spec
- [x] Complexity deviations documented - No deviations identified
