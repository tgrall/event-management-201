## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: Who should be able to create and edit events, sessions, and speakers in the system? → A: Anyone can view, create, and edit all content (open system)
- Q: What are the expected performance targets for page loading and user interactions? → A: Fast (< 2 seconds page load, < 500ms interactions)
- Q: What is the expected scale in terms of concurrent users and number of events? → A: Small scale (< 100 concurrent users, < 50 events)
- Q: What specific responsive design breakpoints should the system support? → A: Standard breakpoints (320px mobile, 768px tablet, 1024px desktop)
- Q: What level of data backup and recovery is needed for the system? → A: No backup required (development/demo system)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
An event organizer needs to create and manage a multi-day conference with multiple sessions, speakers, and tracks. They want to automatically generate time slots, assign sessions to specific times, categorize content by tracks and tags, and allow attendees to view and filter the agenda based on their interests.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no events exist, **When** an organizer creates a 3-day event (Oct 15-17, 2025), **Then** the system generates 30 hourly time slots (10 per day, 8am-6pm) automatically
2. **Given** an event exists with time slots, **When** an organizer creates a session with title, description, speakers, track, and time slot, **Then** the session appears in the agenda for that specific day and time
3. **Given** multiple sessions exist, **When** an attendee filters by a specific track (e.g., "Frontend"), **Then** only sessions assigned to that track are displayed
4. **Given** speakers exist in the system, **When** an organizer assigns multiple speakers to a session, **Then** all speaker details and social links are displayed with the session
5. **Given** sessions have tags, **When** an attendee searches by tag (e.g., "JavaScript"), **Then** all sessions with that tag are returned
6. **Given** multiple sessions are scheduled, **When** an attendee views the agenda by day, **Then** sessions are organized by time slots with track colors and speaker information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an organizer tries to schedule a session outside the event date range?
- How does the system handle when an event end date is before the start date?
- What happens when multiple sessions are scheduled in the same time slot (parallel tracks)?
- How are social links validated for speakers?
- What happens when a session is created without any speakers assigned?
