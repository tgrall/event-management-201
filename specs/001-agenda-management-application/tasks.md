# Tasks: Agenda Management Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-agenda-management-application/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Tech stack: TypeScript/JavaScript, React 18+, Express.js, SQLite
   → Structure: Web app (backend + frontend)
2. Load design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: 6 entities (Event, Session, Speaker, Track, Tag, TimeSlot)
   → contracts/: 4 API files (events, sessions, speakers, tracks-tags)
   → research.md: Technology decisions and rationale
   → quickstart.md: 6 test scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting, PWA config
   → Tests: contract tests (4), integration tests (6), accessibility/performance
   → Core: models (6), services (5), API endpoints (15+)
   → Integration: DB, middleware, frontend-backend connection
   → Polish: unit tests, performance optimization, documentation
4. Task rules applied:
   → Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Models before services before endpoints
5. Tasks numbered T001-T065
6. Dependencies tracked and documented
7. Parallel execution examples provided
8. Validation: All contracts, entities, and scenarios covered ✓
```

## Parallel Example
```
# Phase 3.2: Launch all contract tests together
Task: "Contract test POST /api/events in backend/tests/contract/events.test.js"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/sessions in backend/tests/contract/sessions.test.js"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/speakers in backend/tests/contract/speakers.test.js"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/tracks in backend/tests/contract/tracks-tags.test.js"

# Phase 3.3: Launch all model creation together
Task: "Event model with validation in backend/src/models/event.js"
Task: "Session model with relationships in backend/src/models/session.js"
Task: "Speaker model with social links in backend/src/models/speaker.js"
Task: "Track model in backend/src/models/track.js"
Task: "Tag model in backend/src/models/tag.js"
Task: "TimeSlot model with auto-generation in backend/src/models/time-slot.js"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each completed task
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Ensure performance targets (<2s page load, <500ms interactions)

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Contracts**: 4 contract files → 9 contract test tasks [P]
2. **From Data Model**: 6 entities → 6 model creation tasks [P] + 5 service tasks [P]
3. **From Quickstart**: 6 user scenarios → 6 integration test tasks [P]
4. **From Plan**: Web app structure → frontend/backend separation with PWA features
5. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration → Polish
6. **Dependencies**: Tests block implementation, models block services, services block endpoints

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All 4 contract files have corresponding tests (T011-T019)
- [x] All 6 entities have model tasks (T035-T040)
- [x] All 6 quickstart scenarios have integration tests (T020-T025)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Constitutional requirements addressed (responsive, accessible, performant, PWA)
