# Research: Agenda Management Application

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework: React 18+
**Decision**: React 18+ with TypeScript for the frontend application
**Rationale**: 
- Excellent ecosystem for component-driven architecture (Constitutional Principle IV)
- Strong accessibility support with React Testing Library and screen reader compatibility (Principle III)
- Mature PWA tooling with Create React App and Workbox integration (Principle V)
- Built-in performance optimization features like concurrent rendering and Suspense
**Alternatives considered**: Vue.js, Angular - React chosen for better component testing ecosystem and PWA tooling

### Backend Framework: Express.js with Node.js
**Decision**: Express.js with Node.js 18+ for REST API backend
**Rationale**:
- Rapid development for demo/development system requirements
- JavaScript/TypeScript consistency across frontend and backend
- Excellent middleware ecosystem for validation, security headers, and CORS
- Simple deployment and lightweight for <100 concurrent users
**Alternatives considered**: FastAPI (Python), Spring Boot (Java) - Express chosen for development speed and JS consistency

### Database: SQLite
**Decision**: SQLite for data persistence with no backup requirements
**Rationale**:
- Perfect for demo/development system with <50 events requirement
- Zero configuration and maintenance overhead
- File-based storage aligns with "no backup required" clarification
- Sufficient performance for small-scale requirements
**Alternatives considered**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB - SQLite chosen for simplicity and demo system requirements

### CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design implementation
**Rationale**:
- Excellent mobile-first responsive design utilities (Constitutional Principle I)
- Built-in accessibility features and ARIA support
- Granular control over breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px as specified)
- Tree-shaking capabilities for performance optimization (Principle II)
**Alternatives considered**: Bootstrap, CSS-in-JS - Tailwind chosen for mobile-first approach and performance

### Testing Stack: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
**Decision**: Comprehensive testing with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright
**Rationale**:
- Jest for unit testing with 90%+ coverage target (Constitutional Principle VII)
- React Testing Library for accessibility-focused component testing (Principle III)
- Playwright for cross-browser E2E testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Lighthouse CI integration for performance testing (Principle II)
**Alternatives considered**: Cypress, Selenium - Playwright chosen for better cross-browser support

### PWA Implementation: Workbox
**Decision**: Workbox service worker library for PWA features
**Rationale**:
- Robust offline functionality for agenda viewing (Constitutional Principle V)
- Automatic service worker generation and caching strategies
- Web app manifest integration for installation capability
- Performance optimization through intelligent precaching
**Alternatives considered**: Manual service worker, PWA Builder - Workbox chosen for reliability and automation

## Performance Strategy

### Bundle Optimization
**Decision**: Webpack 5 with code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking
**Rationale**:
- Code splitting by route and component for <2s page load requirement
- Dynamic imports for session details and speaker profiles
- Tree shaking to eliminate unused code and meet bundle size targets
- Asset optimization for WebP/AVIF image formats

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-layer caching with service worker and HTTP caching
**Rationale**:
- Service worker caches critical app shell for instant loading
- API responses cached for offline agenda viewing
- Static assets cached with long TTL for performance
- Cache invalidation strategy for real-time session updates

## Security Implementation

### Input Validation
**Decision**: Joi validation library for comprehensive input sanitization
**Rationale**:
- Schema-based validation for all API endpoints
- Client-side validation for immediate user feedback
- XSS protection through input sanitization
- Type-safe validation with TypeScript integration

### Security Headers
**Decision**: Helmet.js middleware for security headers
**Rationale**:
- CSP (Content Security Policy) for XSS protection
- HSTS enforcement for HTTPS-only access
- Frame options and XSS protection headers
- Lightweight implementation suitable for demo system

## Accessibility Implementation

### Screen Reader Support
**Decision**: Semantic HTML with ARIA labels and roles
**Rationale**:
- Navigation landmarks for agenda structure
- ARIA labels for speaker social links and session filters
- Focus management for keyboard navigation
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic content updates

### Keyboard Navigation
**Decision**: Full keyboard accessibility with visible focus indicators
**Rationale**:
- Tab order through agenda items and filters
- Escape key handling for modal dialogs
- Arrow key navigation for agenda time slots
- Skip links for main content areas

## Development Workflow

### Build Process
**Decision**: Vite for frontend, nodemon for backend development
**Rationale**:
- Hot module reloading for development efficiency
- Fast build times for <500ms interaction targets
- TypeScript compilation and type checking
- Development server with proxy for API integration

### Code Quality
**Decision**: ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks
**Rationale**:
- Consistent code formatting across team
- Accessibility linting with eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
- Pre-commit testing and linting enforcement
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
